
Tokenization: Your code successfully tokenizes input files, 
recognizing keywords (message, struct, header, field) 
as well as identifiers, types, semicolons, braces, and colons.

Line Numbers: Your code correctly tracks line numbers and updates them for multi-line tokens 
such as braces, semicolons, and colons.

Print Function: The printToken function nicely formats token information 
including the token's line number, value, and type.

Error Handling: Your code includes basic error handling for 
file opening and unknown tokens, which is a good practice.
